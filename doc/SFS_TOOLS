  SFS_TOOLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This file describes various tools that come with SFS.

  These tools are usually equivalent to existing programs in unix and
  provide additional functionality. Thay can be merged with them in the
  future.

  sfsd
  ~~~~
  Runs as root. When run under different user it can serve just files of that
user. It provides the main functionality of SFS. It does all the encryption,
decryption and key management.

  The programs from distribution include, aside from sfsd and libsfs, the
  following:

  sfs_login
  ~~~~~~~~~
  Gets user password and uses that to decrypt user private key and send it to
sfsd. In our implementation has to be setuid so that noone can write their own
sfs_login that would spy the passwords. sfs_login has to authentificate itself
to daemon and that can be don just while setuid.

  sfs_chmod
  ~~~~~~~~~
  Used to change files state to and from encrypted:

  $ sfs_chmod +e filename
  $ sfs_chmod -e filename

  sfs_adduser
  ~~~~~~~~~~~
  Run by root to generate users pairs of asymetric keys. Also generates
keys for user group.

  sfs_passwd
  ~~~~~~~~~~
  Used when user wants to change his/her password. It gets user encrypted
private key - decrypts it with old password and reencrypts it with the new one.
Finally it stores the encrypted password for future use.
