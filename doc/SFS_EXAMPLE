-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * This file will take you step by step to the wonderful world of SFS *

  First you have to start the daemon:

  $ sfsd

  You have to ensure that libsfs is called instead of standard library. That
  is achieved by setting LD_PRELOAD variable. You have a script prepared for
  that so just type:
 
  $ . sfs_start

  To unset the variable use similarly sfs_stop.
  Next you have to generate your private and public keys:

  $ adduser
  
  enter your username and password that you want to log into SFS with.
  Now log into SFS:

  $ sfs_login

  Choose a file you want to encrypt and perform the following on it:

  $ sfs_chmod +e filename

  Now your file 'filename' is encrypted but you can work with it as if it
  were still plaintext.  You can do the following:

  $ cat filename
